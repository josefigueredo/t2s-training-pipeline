## Core Concepts

### TTS (Text-to-Speech)

The process of converting written text into spoken audio. Modern TTS systems use deep learning to generate natural-sounding speech that mimics human voice patterns, intonation, and emotion.

### Speech Synthesis Pipeline

The complete process from text to audio:

1. **Text Analysis**: Processing input text (normalization, phonemization)
2. **Acoustic Modeling**: Converting text to acoustic features (mel-spectrograms)
3. **Vocoding**: Converting acoustic features to audio waveforms

### Dataset

A collection of paired data (text + audio recordings) used to train TTS models. Quality datasets require:

- Clear, consistent voice recordings
- Accurate transcriptions
- Sufficient diversity in content
- Proper audio formatting (sample rate, bit depth)

---

## Audio Processing Terms

### Sample Rate (Hz)

The number of audio samples captured per second. Common rates:

- **24,000 Hz (24kHz)**: Used in this project for SNAC compatibility
- **22,050 Hz**: Common in speech processing
- **44,100 Hz**: CD quality audio
- **48,000 Hz**: Professional audio standard

Higher sample rates capture more detail but require more storage and processing.

### Mono vs Stereo

- **Mono**: Single audio channel, used for speech (smaller files, simpler processing)
- **Stereo**: Two channels (left/right), unnecessary for single-speaker TTS

### WAV Format

Uncompressed audio format that preserves full quality. Preferred for training because:

- No quality loss from compression
- Direct sample access
- Wide compatibility
- Simple structure

### PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)

Digital representation of analog audio signals. PCM-16 means:

- 16 bits per sample
- 65,536 possible amplitude values
- Good balance of quality and file size

### Mel-Spectrogram

A visual representation of audio that shows:

- **Time** (horizontal axis)
- **Frequency** (vertical axis, mel scale)
- **Intensity** (color/brightness)

The "mel scale" mimics human hearing perception, emphasizing frequencies we hear better.

### Silence Trimming

Removing quiet sections at the beginning/end of recordings to:

- Reduce file size
- Improve training efficiency
- Standardize audio clips
- Focus on actual speech content

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

### Neural Network

A computational model inspired by biological brains, consisting of:

- **Neurons/Nodes**: Processing units
- **Layers**: Groups of neurons (input, hidden, output)
- **Weights**: Connection strengths between neurons
- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear transformations

### Deep Learning

Using neural networks with many layers (deep) to learn complex patterns. Enables:

- Automatic feature extraction
- Hierarchical representation learning
- Superior performance on complex tasks

### Training

The process of teaching a model to perform a task by:

1. **Forward Pass**: Input data flows through the network
2. **Loss Calculation**: Measuring prediction errors
3. **Backpropagation**: Computing gradients of errors
4. **Weight Update**: Adjusting parameters to reduce errors

### Fine-tuning

Starting with a pre-trained model and adapting it to a specific task or dataset. Benefits:

- Faster training (leverages existing knowledge)
- Less data required
- Better performance on specialized tasks

### Inference

Using a trained model to make predictions on new data. In TTS:

- Input: Text string
- Output: Audio waveform

- **Discriminator**: Distinguishes real from fake (tries to catch generator)

The competition drives both networks to improve, resulting in high-quality generation.
